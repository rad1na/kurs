        [Intro]
        Yeah
        
        [Verse 1]
        I've been tryna call
        I've been on my own for long enough
        Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
        I'm going through withdrawals
        You don't even have to do too much
        You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        I look around and
        Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
        No one's around to judge me (Oh)
        I can't see clearly when you're gone
        
        [Chorus]
        I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
        No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
        Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
        Hey, hey, hey
        
        [Verse 2]
        I'm running out of time
        'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
        So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        The city's cold and empty (Oh)
        No one's around to judge me (Oh)
        I can't see clearly when you're gone
        
        [Chorus]
        I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
        No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
        Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
        
        [Bridge]
        I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
        I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
        Will never let you go this time (Ooh)
        
        [Chorus]
        I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
        No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        Hey, hey, hey
        Hey, hey, hey
        
        [Outro]
        I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
        No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

        [Intro]
        Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro (Sheesh)
        Ayy (Ayy)
        Young Metro, young Metro
        
        [Verse 1]
        Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
        Tryna find the one that can fix me
        I've been dodgin' death in the six speed
        Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
        Yeah, I want it all now
        I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
        Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
        Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
        
        [Chorus]
        Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
        And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
        All this money and this pain got me heartless
        Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
        Said I'm heartless
        Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
        Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
        Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
        
        [Verse 2]
        Said I'm heartless
        So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
        Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
        Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
        Yeah, I got her watchin'
        Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
        Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
        Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
        Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
        I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now ('Zaar)
        Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
        Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now
        
        [Chorus]
        Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
        And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
        All this money and this pain got me heartless
        Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
        Said I'm heartless
        Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
        Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
        Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
        
        [Bridge]
        I lost my heart and my mind
        I try to always do right
        I thought I lost you this time
        You just came back in my life
        You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
        I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
        I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
        You hear it clear in my tone
        
        [Chorus]
        'Cause I'm heartless
        And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
        All this money and this pain got me heartless
        Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
        Said I'm heartless
        Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
        Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
        Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

        [Verse 1]
        White shirt now red, my bloody nose
        Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
        Creepin' around like no one knows
        Think you're so criminal
        Bruises on both my knees for you
        Don't say thank you or please
        I do what I want when I'm wanting to
        My soul? So cynical
        
        [Chorus]
        So you're a tough guy
        Like it really rough guy
        Just can't get enough guy
        Chest always so puffed guy
        I'm that bad type
        Make your mama sad type
        Make your girlfriend mad tight
        Might seduce your dad type
        I'm the bad guy
        Duh
        
        [Post-Chorus]
        I'm the bad guy
        
        [Verse 2]
        I like it when you take control
        Even if you know that you don't
        Own me, I'll let you play the role
        I'll be your animal
        My mommy likes to sing along with me
        But she won't sing this song
        If she reads all the lyrics
        She'll pity the men I know
        
        [Chorus]
        So you're a tough guy
        Like it really rough guy
        Just can't get enough guy
        Chest always so puffed guy
        I'm that bad type
        Make your mama sad type
        Make your girlfriend mad tight
        Might seduce your dad type
        I'm the bad guy
        Duh
        
        [Post-Chorus]
        I'm the bad guy, duh
        I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
        
        [Bridge]
        I like when you get mad
        I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
        You said she's scared of me?
        I mean, I don't see what she sees
        But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
        
        [Outro]
        I'm a bad guy
        I'm, I'm a bad guy
        Bad guy, bad guy
        I'm a bad
